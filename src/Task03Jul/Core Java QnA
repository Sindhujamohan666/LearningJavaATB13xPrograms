1) If there is no main method, what will happen?
Ans: If there is no main method in a Java program, the program will not run
and will throw a runtime error when you try to execute it

2) Does main method return any value?
Ans: No, the main method does not return any value ‚Äî its return type is void.
public static void main(String[] args)

3) what is main method?
Ans: The main method in Java is the entry point of any standalone Java application.

4) (String[] args) what is this in main method?
Ans:the part (String[] args) is the parameter of the method. Let's break it down:
    String[] ‚Äî This declares an array of Strings.
    args ‚Äî This is the name of the array (you can rename it, but "args" is conventional).
    This array stores command-line arguments passed to your Java program when you run it.
    For example, if you run your program like this:
    java MyProgram Hello World 123

5) main(String[] args) in this insted of args can i write something else like java, or Selenium like this (String[] Selenium)?
Ans: In Java, you can rename the parameter name inside the main method ‚Äî
the name args is just a convention. You can use any valid variable name like:
     public static void main(String[] Selenium)

6) public static void main(string args[]) { } is this right main method, is this will work? ([] position is changed)
Ans: This will NOT work ‚Äî and here‚Äôs why:
     1. string should be String (Java is case-sensitive)
     2. string (lowercase) is not a recognized class in Java.
     3. String (uppercase) is a valid class in java.lang package.
     ‚úÖ The position of [] is actually flexible in Java ‚Äî both of the following are valid:
         String[] args
         String args[]

7) public static void main(string[]args) { }, is this right main method, is this will work? (i have removed the space between []args)
Ans : This will NOT work. Here's why:
      üö´ Problem:
      1. You wrote string instead of String.
      2. Java is case-sensitive, and string (lowercase) is not a valid class.
      3. String (uppercase S) is a class from java.lang, and it's required here.
      ‚úÖ Correct version:
      public static void main(String[] args) { }

8) public static void main(string...args) { }, is this right main method, is this will work? ( i have removed [] and added ...)
Ans : ‚ùå This will NOT work ‚Äî because of one key issue:
      üî¥ string should be String (Java is case-sensitive). Lowercase string is not valid.
      ‚úÖ Correct version using varargs (ellipsis ...):

      public static void main(String... args) { }
      Yes ‚Äî this version will work! Here's why:
      String... args is a valid way to declare a varargs (variable-length) array of Strings.
      It is equivalent to String[] args.
      The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) accepts either String[] or String... in the main method.

9) static public void main(String[] args) { is this valid main mehtod ?
Ans : ‚úÖ Yes, this is a valid main method in Java:
      Java allows you to swap the order of modifiers like public and static.
      So both of the following are correct:
      public static void main(String[] args)
      static public void main(String[] args)

      üîç Why is it valid?
      In Java:The order of modifiers (like public and static) doesn‚Äôt affect the meaning.
10) public void static main(String[] args) {} is this valid main method?
Ans : ‚ùå No, this is NOT a valid main method in Java:
       Why?
       Because the order of modifiers matters in terms of syntax.
       While public static is valid and static public is valid, you cannot insert another keyword (like return type void) between them.

       In Java, modifiers (like public and static) must come before the return type and must be grouped together properly.

11) public static main void (String[] args) {} is this valid main method?
Ans: ‚ùå No, this is not valid in Java:
      The order of the method signature must be:
      [modifiers] returnType methodName(parameterList) { ... }
      But in your example:
      main is the method name, but you've placed it before the return type void.
      The return type must come immediately after the modifiers (public static), and before the method name.
12) Who Gets Highest Priority in Execution?
Ans: main method has highest priority in execution
